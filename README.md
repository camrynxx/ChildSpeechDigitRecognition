# ChildSpeechDigitRecognition
This repository contains the evaluation code for a low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that recognises spoken digits from children, as outlined in my skripsie report.
It includes all the functions used to evaluate and compare the accuracy of different methods, namely: different feature extraction types (MFCCs and WavLM), template types (adult, child, and voice-converted adult-to-child), and the tuning and evaluation of prediction methods (minimum cost, k-NN, r-NN, and entropy-based confidence). Lastly, a Monte Carlo subsampling approach has been used to determine how much training data is required to achieve reasonable accuracy. 

This repository also contains all the results shown in the report.

**Note**: The training, validation, and testing data are not included in this repository due to size and privacy constraints.
